This is Synthé 3, a free and open-source text-to-speech engine for french.

Compiling under Linux
=====================

Make sure you have libasound2-dev installed.

The following commands can then be used to compile Synthé 3:

./autogen
./configure
make

This will produce a shared library (libsynthe3.so) and a test executable
(synthe3).

At the moment, the TTS can not be installed (no make install target yet).
It can only be run directly from its sources through the run-synthe3 
script:

./synthe3

This should make the TTS pronounce a hard-coded sentence.

Compiling under Windows
=======================

Download the following archive:

http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx9mgw.zip

This archive contains a dx9mgw folder which itself contains an include and a
lib subfolder.

Copy both include\dsound.h and lib\libdsound.a to the directory
containing this README.

Then do:

MinGW32-make -f Makefile.win

Cross-compiling
===============

In order to produce Windows binaries under Linux, first install:

apt-get install mingw32-binutils gcc-mingw-w64 mingw32-runtime

And then run:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc
